## A How-To Guide to Feature Models

The Sling Feature Model provides a new approach for assembling applications and is intended to replace the Sling Provisioning Model. 
Both approaches accomplish the same goal of defining and assembling OSGi-based applications, however, the Feature Model 
is more robust and is not coupled to Sling. It addresses application packaging concerns by allowing all aspects of an application 
(e.g., bundles, configuration, framework properties, capabilities, requirements and custom artifacts) to be defined declaratively.

### Key Concepts

* Features - Central entity of the Feature Model used to logically group metadata, configuration, bundles and 
  extensions to represent a system module or subsystem. 
* Feature Extension - An extension point for adding new capabilities to the Feature Model. 
* Feature Archives - Packages one or more features and dependencies to simplify the distribution of an application.
* Feature Reference Files - A text descriptor file with a list of features.
* Feature Aggregation - A method for packaging muliple features into a single feature

This how-to is designed to be a progressive tutorial in which each how-to builds on the previous. It's recommended
that you start on the first and work your way through them consecutively.
